# CSE123G9_TRAVIS_RemoteControl
Repository to hold code base for CSE123 Group 9 of 2022 for our voice-activated remote control senior design project loveably named TRAVIS.

TRAVIS stands for Television-Remote-and-Voice-Integrated-System, and is currently in the prototyping phase.
All of our initial design and more administrative-focused work has also been included and summarized within
our Draft Design Document pdf and Interim Presentation powerpoint.

Our current focus is to complete our codebase and physical prototype within such a timeframe
that we will have plenty of time left over to test, iterate, and iron out any and all bugs that appear
before our prototype submission and end-of-quarter presentation and showing.

The TRAVIS Project is currently managed by:
Ann Sophie Abrahamsson, Nathan Banner, Lillian Gwendolyn, Katy Johnson, 
Aidan Martens, Heath Robinson, Kanybek Tashtankulov 
As a senior design project at the University of California, Santa Cruz
and is being overseen by Dr. David C. Harrison.
