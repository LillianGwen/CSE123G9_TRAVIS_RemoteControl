Usage (Windows only!):
1. Download "test_stt_tts_google.py" and/or "test_stt_tts_sphinx.py"
2. Make sure you have Python installed
3. cd to the folder containing the file
4. Type ".\test_stt_tts_google.py -c" or ".\test_stt_tts_sphinx.py -c" and a new window should pop up (or it should start running directly in your console)
5. Start speaking. Whatever the program hears, it'll speak back to you after a small delay
